# Single responsibility Principle

Every class in Java should have a single job to do. To be precise, there should only be one reason to change a class. Hereâ€™s an example of a Java class that does not follow the single responsibility principle (SRP):

```java
public class Vehicle {
    public void printDetails() {}
    public double calculateValue() {}
    public void addVehicleToDB() {}
}
```

The Vehicle class has three separate responsibilities: reporting, calculation, and database. By applying SRP, we can separate the above class into three classes with separate responsibilities.
